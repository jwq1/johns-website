            I have always loved animation; although, I am not quite sure why.

            You know how some people say they can’t get a song out of their head? Or, in my cousins case, math and SAT prep. I think everyone has something like that. The thing their mind returns to when it does not have anything else to think about. For me, that thing is animated stories. Whenever I pause, sit on a park bench, or have some time to think, my mind returns to animated videos. It’s not the most practical thing, mind you. Usually, I wish my brain reverted to more useful topics, like logarithms or something. However, movies and cartoons are always what has drawn my interest, whether it be documentary, fiction, stop-motion, digital 3D, japanese, or American.

            I have my favorite studios, Lycra, Ghibli, and Pixar. I have my favorite animators, Hayao Miyazaki and John Lasseter. I love to learn about the math behind blades of grass and the process behind coming up with a story. Below is a list of some of my favorite content that I thought I would share in case you are a nerd like me.

            <p><em>The making of a stop motion animation film.</em></p>
            Like Wallace and Gromit, many people’s first stop motion animation film, Lycra still uses stop motion animation to create their films. You get to see how 3D printing has improved the animation industry and what it looks like to picture out a movie frame by frame.

            <p><em>The creation of Pixar and the reinvigoration of Disney animation</em></p>
            This book talks about more than only the making of a company. It highlights the changes in the animation industry, how 3D animation engines came to be, team dynamics in animation studio, funding deadlines and risk taking. It is one of the most engaging books I have read that centers around the making of a business.
