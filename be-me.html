            When I went to college, I had a lot of my needs met. I had come out of high school one of the top students in my class, competing well in athletics and academics to the point. The feeling left me kind of empty, without a further purpose. The sentiment lingered a long time throughout college despite going through the motions.          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            I needed a reason to keep living after my basic needs, and those of my family were all met. I did a lot of introspective thinking and searching for why humans lived on the planet in the first place. "Why were we here," I would ask. The question had been asked many times before, but now it was my turn to look for an answer. I did not come up with anything satisfactory. In fact, I determine if there was a purpose for humans to exist, there was no way with our given technology that we could find it.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Instead of looking forward, I started to look back. Humans had grown as a species, like all species with the sole purpose of surviving. Each development in our physique was built to serve that purpose. But the goal is not to survive as an individual. Instead, it is to survive as a species. It is why parents so readily would give their lives for their children. Why spouses would give their lives for a loved one. It might appear cold, but the reason we developed to have such emotions is to propagate ourselves as a species.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            I merged the two pieces of thinking to decide that my purpose would be to extend the lifespan of the human species until one day someone might be able to uncover the reason we are all here.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            It’s this realization that drove my desire to work on sustainable development, not only through sustainable products or systems but through enabling other students to make discoveries that will advance our species on themselves. I primarily focus on health, education, and environmental sustainability because I think that each can beget the other and will extend the longevity of human existence.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            I look forward to working with organizations to make these sustainable development goals a reality.

            <p class="col-12">
              On a much smaller scale, I realized that my privileged position at a wealthy school and high socioeconomic class meant I did not have many repercussions for my actions, or mainly my inaction. In other words, I found I could be lazy in college. If I only thought of myself and my comfort, I would go on being as healthy and comfortable as ever. It was easy to let myself fall into indulgent habits. Nothing crazy, only too much time spent in conversation and not enough spent at work.            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
              It may sound odd, but when surrounded by no societal pressure, I lost my sense of how I to act. Social forces shape many of our behaviors. Without them, I felt like I floated in ambiguity about how I should behave. It was uncomfortable because I had no compass for the type of person I wanted to grow into.
            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
              I found that books had the answer. A friend of mine recommended The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, because she thought I reminded her of the main character Howard Roark. She never told me why, so I am not sure whether this was a positive, negative, or neutral comment. However, I started to read the book and realized that Ayn Rand was right in many regards. Howard Roark was a guidepost for how I would like to conduct myself.
            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
              I continued on to read Plato’s Republic, this book was an even greater impact on my psyche, because it instilled values like that work should always be for others, doing one’s work without getting in the way of others’ work is justice, and that living justly makes a happier, better life.
            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
              Later I found Elon Musk’s biography, where I saw how an entrepreneur could enact the values I espoused in a modern context.
            </p>
            <p class="col-12">
              There are many more books besides these that I started to come across that created images of the type of person I wanted to be. These books are my role models for everyday interaction, and I regularly learn more. Most recently, Lab Girl and Hillbilly Elegy painted excellent pictures of who I wanted to become. <em>(If you’re curious, War & Peace, Letters from a Stoic by Seneca and the Inheritance Cycle are good as well.)</em>
